# European Alien Species Information NetworkThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [European Alien Species Information Network APIs](http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/use-easin/web-services). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [European Alien Species Information Network APIs](http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/use-easin/web-services).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/use-easin/web-services)- [Developer](http://easin.jrc.ec.europa.eu/use-easin/web-services)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EU_Commission)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/european-alien-species-information-network/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the European Alien Species Information Network APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
